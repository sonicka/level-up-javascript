<!-- Each vendor has a menu and some vendors might be serving the same item.
Given an array of food truck menus where each menu is an array, return one
master menu, which contains all food items that will be served at the festival without
duplicates. We'll take this unique menu and use dom manipulation to create an unordered
list containing these unique menu items. You should have an unordered list with an idea
of combined menu in your HTML that you can use to append the list node children too.  -->
