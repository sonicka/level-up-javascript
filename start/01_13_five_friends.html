<!-- 
In this challenge, you're building a new component for Your Space, a brand new social
media application that allows you to find friends. This component displays a user's top
five friends. Given some JSON data returned from the random user API, you should dynamically
generate image thumbnails for the top five friends. You should use the fetch API to call the
random user API. You can use the URL https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5 to get data for
five users. Your solution should also use async/await.
