/*
In this challenge, you'll build a password validator for a signup form which tests whether
or not a user's desired password is strong enough. You must use a regular expression in
your solution. If the user's password is strong enough, return the string, your password
is valid. Otherwise, return the string, your password is invalid. You must also use a
ternary operator to return a boolean value. Ternary operators check to see if a certain
condition has been met. We follow the expression we want to check with a question mark,
and if the condition is truthy, it will execute the code following the question mark.
The truthy expression is followed by a colon and if the condition is falsey, it will
execute the following code. Here are the criteria which must be met in order for a
password to be strong enough. The password must have at least one lower case letter.
The password must have at least one upper case letter. It must contain one digit and
one special character, and it must be at least eight characters long.
